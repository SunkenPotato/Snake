# Snake


## Usage
Snake is a simple game where you have to guide the snake to the apples, which in this version of the game, are white squares(⬜️). Control the snake's movement with the UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT keys (↑ ↓ → ←). If you crash into the walls, it is game over. Same thing happens if you crash into your own body.
